# Calculate Single-Precision Floating-Point Strided Array Mean with NaN Values Ignored

Welcome to the "stats-strided-dsnanmeanpn" repository! Here, you can find a reliable solution for calculating the arithmetic mean of a single-precision floating-point strided array. This implementation includes a two-pass error correction algorithm that efficiently handles NaN (Not a Number) values, providing an extended precision result.

If you are working with arrays containing NaN values and require an accurate mean calculation, this functionality will be a valuable addition to your project. This algorithm ensures precise results even in the presence of missing or invalid data points, enhancing the robustness of your statistical computations.

### Features:
- **Efficient Algorithm:** Utilizes a two-pass error correction algorithm for accurate mean calculation.
- **NaN Handling:** Ignores NaN values to prevent skewing of the mean calculation.
- **Extended Precision Result:** Returns an extended precision result for enhanced accuracy.
- **Strided Array Support:** Designed to process single-precision floating-point strided arrays efficiently.
